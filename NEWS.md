# Development version

Fix `do_deploy_api` using localPath `./`

# plumberDeploy 0.1.4

* Removed `swagger` as an argument for deployment.
* Added checks to see if the application was already present.

# plumberDeploy 0.1.3

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added passthrough for `do_deploy_api` so that `keyfile` works, fixing #12 (@muschellij2).
